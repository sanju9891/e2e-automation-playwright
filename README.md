- 🔌 API Testing: Backend API validation
- 👁️ Visual Testing: Screenshot comparison and visual regression

2. Robust CI/CD Integration

- 🔄 Jenkins Pipeline
- 🐙 GitHub Actions

3. Advanced Testing Capabilities:

- ⚙️ Dynamic test parameterization (environments, test types, workers...)
- 📆 Scheduled test runs (daily regression tests)
- 🔍 Automated PR validation jobs, eg: `Eslint`, `Synk`
- 🔔 Slack notifications for trigger test / test results
- 📍 Run smoke test whenever a PR is merged to web-app

4. 🔌 Integrate between Github & Slack
